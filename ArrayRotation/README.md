This is Function of Array Rotation.
The function use 2 parameters inside the function.
First one is List of integers that length is lesser or equal to 100 and integer inside is in range of [-1000, 1000]
Second one is Integer that is is range of [0, 100]
I'm using a unit test to test this function.
To run unit test use "python -m unittest Array_Rotation.py" in the terminal or Run The File.
